This repository contains code for real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model. The script leverages the ultralytics YOLO implementation and OpenCV for capturing video from a webcam and performing object detection.

### Features  
• Real-Time Object Detection: Uses a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect multiple objects in real-time from a webcam feed.

• Wide Range of Detectable Objects: Capable of detecting a variety of objects, including people, vehicles, animals, furniture, and more.

• Easy Setup: Simple to run with minimal configuration.
